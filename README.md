### Stock Performance Analysis Using the Golden Cross Strategy

#### What is the Objective of this Project?

This project analyzes stock market performance using the Golden Cross trading strategy. The Golden Cross is a technical analysis indicator occurring when a stock's short-term moving average crosses above its long-term moving average, typically indicating a potential bullish market.

#### Which Stocks Were Analyzed?

The stocks analyzed include major market players:
- **SPY (S&P 500 ETF)**
- **AAPL (Apple Inc.)**
- **MSFT (Microsoft Corp.)**
- **NVDA (NVIDIA Corp.)**
- **TSLA (Tesla Inc.)**
- **GOOGL (Alphabet Inc.)**

#### What Methodology Was Used?

We compared the traditional buy-and-hold returns with the returns obtained by following the Golden Cross strategy. This involved calculating returns based on short-term vs. long-term moving average crossovers, and the strategy performance was measured as percentage returns.

#### What Were the Key Results?

The analysis revealed the following results:

| Ticker | Buy-and-Hold ($) | Golden Cross Strategy ($) | Buy-and-Hold (%) | Golden Cross Strategy (%) |
|--------|------------------|---------------------------|------------------|----------------------------|
| SPY    | 32,231.84        | 20,833.13                 | 222.32%          | 108.33%                    |
| AAPL   | 84,378.88        | 52,817.78                 | 743.79%          | 428.18%                    |
| MSFT   | 112,784.04       | 91,682.07                 | 1027.84%         | 816.82%                    |
| NVDA   | 1,896,381.03     | 2,144,864.73              | 18,863.81%       | 21,348.65%                 |
| TSLA   | 133,783.96       | 50,837.05                 | 1237.84%         | 408.37%                    |
| GOOGL  | 51,575.65        | 40,307.94                 | 415.76%          | 303.08%                    |

#### Which Stock Performed Best Using the Golden Cross Strategy?

**NVIDIA (NVDA)** demonstrated the most remarkable performance using the Golden Cross Strategy, yielding an impressive **21,348.65% return**, significantly surpassing its traditional buy-and-hold return of **18,863.81%**.

#### What Insights Can Be Gained From This Analysis?

- Although the Golden Cross Strategy provided superior returns for stocks with strong bullish momentum like NVIDIA, the traditional buy-and-hold strategy generally offered better gains with lower risks in the long run for most analyzed stocks.
- Stocks with less volatility and consistent long-term growth, such as SPY and GOOGL, benefited more clearly from the stability and simplicity of the buy-and-hold approach.
- The Golden Cross emphasizes market timing effectiveness and highlights potential entry points, but it also introduces additional risk and complexity compared to passive investment strategies.

#### Conclusion and Future Recommendations

This analysis highlights the potential advantages of the Golden Cross strategy in specific scenarios but ultimately underscores the effectiveness of buy-and-hold for consistent and lower-risk long-term investment gains. Future projects may include testing additional stocks, extending the time frame, or combining other technical indicators to further optimize investment strategies.
